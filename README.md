# AprenderHaciendo - C#

2014 ecommerce platform created for a specific client in mind, but adapted for re-usability with placeholder images and text. Allows to be customized without much effort for other purposes. It features Bootstrap, HTML, CSS3 and a C#-MSSQL Backend, with an Admin session login for content to be submitted by the user and also an unfinished PayPal and Online Shopping session. Compiled and edited with MS Visual Studio 2013. The project was developed during our university studies for a specific course in a 4-month timeframe.

We originally used Bitbucket to host a private Repo and commits, so the whole project will appear as a single commit over here on Github.
